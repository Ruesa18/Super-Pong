# Super Pong
A single-player pong with a little twist.

You can play against yourself in a basic pong game. After 10 times of hitting the ball, a special mode will be triggered. This mode will randomly change the direction of the ball every once in a while. This makes the game a bit more interesting.
The special mode also increases the speed regularly. This means that it not only gets difficult because the ball decides to go another way, it also gets more difficult the longer you play.

## Score
In order to compete with your friends you get a little score output at the top of the screen. The score is basically just a counter of how often you've hit the ball.

## Installation
It's basically a little website. If you want to play locally you can just download the repository and open the `index.html` file in any browsers of yours.

(To host it you will need a webserver that serves the files)
