# Super Pong
A single-player pong with a little twist.

You can play against yourself in a basic pong game. After 10 times of hitting the ball, a mode will be triggered. This mode starts a timer that will change the direction of the ball when fully depleted. This makes the game a bit more interesting as the ball can randomly change its direction.
